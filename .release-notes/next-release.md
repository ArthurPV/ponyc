## FreeBSD is no longer a supported platform

We no longer have access to hardware that we can test FreeBSD on as part of our regular Continous Integration and Release cycles. As such, we are removing FreeBSD as a supported platform. We will make best effort attempts to not break FreeBSD, however, it is likely to fall behind and need maintenance from interested community members.

## Add macOS on Intel support

We've re-added macOS on Intel as a fully supported platform. Nightly and release builds will are available via `ponyup`.

We plan on maintaining macOS on Intel support for as long as we are doing our builds on GitHub Actions and GitHub provides macOS Intel runners.
