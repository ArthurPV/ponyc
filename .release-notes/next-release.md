## Fedora 39 added as a supported platform

We've added Fedora 39 as a supported platform. We'll be building ponyc releases for it until it stops receiving security updates at the end of 2024. At that point, we'll stop building releases for it.

## Add support for MacOS on Apple Silicon

Back in August of 2023, we had to drop MacOS on Apple Silicon as a supported platform as we had no Apple Silicon test and build environment. We lost our existing environment when we had to migrate off of CirrusCI.

GitHub recently announced that they now have Apple Silicon MacOS machines so, we are back in business and MacOS on Apple Silicon is once again a supported platform.
