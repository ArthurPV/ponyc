## Fix: Segmentation fault when ponyc compiles this code

Fix an issue caused by passing a wrong expression to `consume`.

With this change, instead of the compiler generating a
segmentation fault, it generates the error message: "You cannot
consume an expression that is not local. Specifically, you can
only consume a local variable (a single lowercase identifier, without
a dot) or a this field (this followed by a dot and a single lowercase
identifier)".
